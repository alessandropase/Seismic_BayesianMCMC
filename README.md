# Bayesian Inference and Uncertainty Quantification in Seismic Data Modelling
## Description
This project implements Bayesian inference to analyze uncertainty in seismic data, exploring probabilistic inverse problems. 

A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, specifically the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, is used to sample from the Bayesian posterior probability distribution, offering insights into the potential epicenter of seismic events.

The project also explores adaptive techniques to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the sampling.

The advisor of the project was professor Marteen Arnst from University of Liège.
